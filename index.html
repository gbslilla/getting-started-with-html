    <h1> Introduction to programming</h1>
    <h2> Basics of web</h2>

    <p>
      <b>
        - HTML<br>
        - URL <br>
        - HTTP <br>
        - Applications
      </b>
    </p>

    <!-- <p> or paragraph are like invisible boxes, separates the contents-->  
    <p>
      People use <b><em>browsers</em></b> and <em>search engines</em> to make requests through the internet.
      These requests exist in a form of <b><em>HTTP</em></b> which is <em>protocol</em> the browser uses to make these requests.
      HTTP requests are accepted by the <em><b>servers</b></em> which are <em>computers that hosts data</em> and sends files back in reply to requests. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>HTML</b> or <b><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></b> is the most common type of contents you can 
      find on the web together with pictures, music, links and other documents. HTML is a coding language
      that creates websites. It consists of <em>links, tags</em> or <em>markups</em> and the <em>language code</em> itself.
    </p>

    <!-- <br> stands for break and it is very similar to the effect that you get when you press enter in a text file -->
    <br>
    <h3>HTML mark ups</h3>
    
    <p>
      Mark ups or tags are functions that give order to the your computer.
      <br>
    <!-- Not all tags have contents. I am going to mention about this later-->
      HTML is made up of elements. Each element consist of an
      <br>
      <br> - opening tag,
      <br> - contents,
      <br> - closing tag.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>< opening tag ></b> data <b>< / closing tag ></b><br>
      <br>example: 
      <br><em>This  <b> word </b> is bold. </em>
      <br>
      <br>
      The tags gave order to my computer to show the word bold.
    </p>
    <br>
    <!-- I am sure that there is a way how to show these caracters without letting the computer to read them,
    but I do not know it yet-->  
    <h4>Tags</h4>
    <p>
      <b> < b ></b> contents <b>< /b ></b> - b stands for bold and make the word <b>bold</b>.
      <br>
      <b><em>< em ></em></b> contents <b><em>< /em></em></b> - em stands for <em>emphasized</em>.
      <br>
      <b>< i ></b> contents <b>< /i ></b> - i stands for italic and make the contents <i>slanted</i>.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Attributes</h4>
    <p>
      You can also include links in HTML contents and the way to do it is to include a:
      <br>
      <br>- tag with an attribute and the particular value,
      <br>- a word, part of your text or your "link"
      <br>- and a closing tag.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>< tag  ATTR = "value" ></b> contents <b>< closing tag ></b> 
      <br><b>< a href = "URL" ></b> your chosen word <b>< /a ></b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> < a > </b> stands for anchor,this is the opening tag,
      <br><b>href</b> is the name of the attribure,
      <br><b>< /a ></b> is the closing tag
      <br>
      <br>
      example:<br>
      <em>This <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=5j5wVYjHJeWq8wfrvoFg&gws_rd=ssl">website</a> is your best friend.</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Images</h4>
    <p>
      Other feature of HTML that you can include pictures in your webpage.
      <br>
      We use the image tag and the text which will carry the title of the image.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>< img  src = "URL" alt = "text" ></b>
      <br>
      <br>
      example: <br>
      <em><img src="http://www.alberts-mcatprepua.com/chemistry.jpg" alt="chemistry"> is an <b>amazing</b> science subject.</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Some tags does not have contents, these tags are called <b>void tags</b>. Image is one of these void tags.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Tags are also distinguished by their property of being a part of an <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b> element. <i>Inline</i> tags can
      be placed into the text-line without breaking that while <i>block</i> elements creat an invisible block around the text breaking the structure.
      These block elements can also be altered by other coding languages as CSS or JS.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Inline tags</b>
      <br>
      <br> 
      < a > anchor,<br>
      < b > bold,<br>
      < br > break,<br>
      < em > emphasized,<br>
      < i > italic,<br>
      < img > image,<br>
      < span > Span makes it possible to alter the word's size, colour by other coding language.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Block tags</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      < p > paragraph, <br>
      < div > Similar to span but a block tag,<br>
      < form >
    <!-- Not sure what is form used for yet -->    
    </p>
